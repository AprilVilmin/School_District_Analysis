# PyCity School District Analysis with Pandas

## Overview of the school district analysis:
This project is responsible for analzing test score information for standardized tests for both charter and district schools for the PyCity School District. The request is for all levels of data analysis including reporting and presentation. The data for this project is coming from several sources. The information gathered through this project/analysis will be used by the school board and other school district leaders to make decisions on spending, staffing and more. The more information the school district has the better strategically informed decisions they can make. 

### Explain the purpose of this analysis
The PyCity School District School Board believes that the students_complete.csv file displays evidence of cheating for ninth graders at Thomas High School. The School Board does not want these scores to diminish the integrity of state standardized testing. For this reason the school board has requested that the reading and math scores for students at Thomas High School be replaced with NaNs and that the rest of the analysis be reran.
